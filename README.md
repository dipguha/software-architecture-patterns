# Lecture 1: Cloud Computing SA Patterns
1. Why do we need Software Architecture patterns
  1. Solution to common problem and non-functional requirements 
3. Differnece bwtween design patterns vs cloud software architecture patterns
4. System requirements
   1. Functional requirements - dictate the features of the product. Business logic and user experience.
   2. Quality attributes - scalability, reliability, availability, performance, security and cost, organizational scalability/extensibility, developer productivity
   3. System constraints - limit the design choices
 5. Design patterns (factory, 
    1. Better code organization
    2. reusability
    3. extensibility
    4. Developer productivity
    5. Mostly for Object oriented programming languages
    6. limited to single apps/library
  7. Cloud computing pattern
     1. Access to infinite computation, storage, network - IaaS
     2. Tools and features to improve
        1. Performance - multi region deployment - close to users
        2. Scalability - multi zone deployment - 
        3. Reliability and availability
     3. Platform with services like Database, Message Brokers, Load Balancers, Monitoring, Log services, FaaS
     4. Drawback
       1. Cost awareness
       2. Built for failure
       3. Building reliable system using unreliable components
       4.
